PROJECTOR-CAMERA CALIBRATION SOFTWARE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

The software requires Qt and OpencV libraries. It should run on any system that 
satisfies those requirements. It has been developed and tested using Qt 4.8.4 
and OpencV 2.4.3 in Microsoft Windows 7. It has also been tried in Debian GNU/Linux 
and Mac OS X and while it builds and runs fine no extensive testing has been done on 
these platforms.

Feel free to modify the paths on top of 'build/projector-calib.pro'.
